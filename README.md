# OptoGraphs
Is a ongoing project designed to create graphics to test the optomotor and optokinetic response of larval fishes. Currently, known methods for creating graphics to test visual response of larval fish utilizes code for paid licences programs like MatLab. I was tasked with the job of creating a simplified and free alternative for the students in my lab to use for their undergraduate and graduate projects. OptoGraphs is a series of R scripts utilizing two methods for creating .gif graphics using two open source resources (ImageJ & ImageMagick).
