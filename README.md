# OptoGraphs
Two R functions were designed to create two simple assays for testing the optomotor and optokinetic response of larval fish. Included is a  short vignette to describe steps of how to create a .gif image using two methods in R. The first method, described in the OptioGraphs with ImageJ, is by creating several .png images and turning them into .gif or .avi files using ImageJ. The second method, described in OptioGraphs with ImageMagick, utilizes ImageMagick package by creating a .gif through the command line. Please note that each assay has code for both types of saving methods.
